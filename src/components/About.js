            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Based out of Toronto, Canada. Being a passionate young musician didn't pay the bills so in 2007 I taught myself how to code. In 2013 I built Live Wallpaper Games that went on to garner over 400k downloads within 2 months of release without push, not to mention my music reaching thousands of people also. So here we are in 2022 where I work full time at Fisidi Inc. to build out feasible Play to Earn mechanisms for the passive earner and casual gamer alike.
